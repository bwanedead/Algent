# Documentation Hub

Central place for project-wide documentation. Keep high-level and cross-cutting
notes here (vision, roadmap, onboarding, UI sketches, etc.). Component-specific
docs live in `backend/docs/` and `frontend/docs/`.

## Suggested structure

- `holistic-vision.md` – overarching ecosystem vision (fill with latest pivot).
- `algo-lab-vision.md` – original Algent/algorithm behavior lab narrative.
- `tech-stack.md` – summary of backend/frontend/tooling choices.
- `credentials.md` – how to provide API keys (env vars, keyring).
- `roadmap.md` – future milestones (placeholder for now).
- `notes/` – scratch explorations or design spikes.

Feel free to reorganize as the project matures.
